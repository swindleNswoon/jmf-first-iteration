    <p>The Jack Mattsson Foundation was established in 2018 to honor our son/brother
        Jack and his wishes after losing a battle against Osteosarcoma in 2017. It is a rare
        disease that mostly impacts teenagers and young adults. Nobody fought the fight
        better than he. So many people made a tremendous impact on Jack and our family
        during the battle. Family, friends, community, and strangers all were part of Jack’s
        Army and showed tremendous compassion and generosity during Jack’s difficult
        times. We are forever grateful and aim to give back and pay forward to others who
        have trying times.</p>
